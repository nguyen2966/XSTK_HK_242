🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone the Repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd BTL_PD

2. Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed. Then install all required libraries:

pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Prepare Your Data
Place your dataset(s) inside the data/ directory. The scripts are configured to load data from that folder.

4. Run the Scripts
Navigate to the src/ directory and run the desired script:

cd src
python KNN_process.py
python OLS_Regression_Model.py
python Thong_Ke_Mo_Ta.py

5. View Results
All generated plots and charts will be saved in the Chart/ folder automatically.

📦 Dependencies
The requirements.txt includes all required libraries:
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
statsmodels
dataframe-image
scipy

Install them with:
pip install -r requirements.txt

📊 Output
Visualizations from the analysis are saved in the Chart/ directory.

Descriptive statistics, regression models, and imputation results are handled by the scripts in src/.
