🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/nguyen2966/XSTK_HK_242.git
cd XSTK_HK_242
```

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the Scripts
Navigate to the src/ directory and run the desired script:
```sh
cd src
```
```sh
python KNN_process.py
python Thong_Ke_Mo_Ta.py
python 1_and_2_Samples_Test.py
python Anova_Model.py
python OLS_Regression_Model.py
```
4. View Results
All generated plots and charts will be saved in the Chart/ folder automatically.
